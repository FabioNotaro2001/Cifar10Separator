# Cifar10Separator

*Created by: Fabio Notaro*  
*A simplified deep‑learning classifier that demonstrates how to “separate” or classify CIFAR‑10 test images by training and evaluating a small neural network.*

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains a single Jupyter notebook (`cifar_10_separation_engcopia.ipynb`) which:

1. Loads the standard **CIFAR‑10 dataset**.
2. Preprocesses the data (normalization, one‑hot encoding, train/test split).
3. Defines a simple **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
4. Trains the model to classify images into the 10 CIFAR‑10 categories.
5. Evaluates performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, example misclassifications).
6. Visualizes sample predictions and intermediate feature maps.

Essentially, it serves as a hands-on educational tool for understanding image classification on CIFAR‑10. The notebook name and structure suggest it’s either used in a lecture or for exporting a polished English version of the project.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)
- GPU – optional but recommended for faster training
- Common libraries:  
  `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `torch` or `tensorflow`, `torchvision` or `keras`, and `scikit‑learn`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Option 1: Clone and open the notebook**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FabioNotaro2001/Cifar10Separator.git
cd Cifar10Separator
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn torch torchvision
# or for TensorFlow-based version
# pip install tensorflow keras
jupyter notebook cifar_10_separation_engcopia.ipynb

Option 2: Use a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you supply one
jupyter lab

    No extra files or scripts included.
    If you modified CIFAR‑10 or generated “separated” mixes (e.g. combined images or labels), explain those here.

🏃 Notebook Outline (typical)

    Section 1 – Setup & Imports:
    Import libraries such as NumPy, Pandas (optional), matplotlib, framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow).

    Section 2 – Data Loading and Preprocessing:

        Downloads CIFAR‑10 via torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10 or tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.

        Normalizes pixel values (0–1 or standardized).

        Applies random transformations (optional).

        Splits into train/test sets.

    Section 3 – Model Definition:

        Defines a simple CNN: 2–3 Conv layers + pooling + fully connected layers + softmax.

        Uses dropout or activation functions.

    Section 4 – Training Loop:

        Configures optimizer (Adam/SGD), loss function (cross‑entropy), learning rate.

        Shows live epoch logs (loss, accuracy).

        Optionally plots training curves.

    Section 5 – Evaluation & Prediction Visualization:

        Calculates test accuracy.

        Displays confusion matrix.

        Shows sample test images with predicted vs actual labels.

        (Possible extension: separates mixed/augmented input by its predicted components if your assignment required blending or separation of two images.)

📈 Expected Output

    Training metrics:
    An accuracy curve over epochs (e.g. 60–80% within 5–10 epochs).

    Evaluation scores:
    Test-set accuracy reported at the end.

    Visualization figures:

        Sample images with correct/incorrect predictions.

        Feature map visualizations (optional).

        Confusion matrix.

    (Optional) Separation demonstration:
    If you implemented a separation mechanism (e.g. predicts two labels from a mixed image), the notebook likely includes an explanation and visual outputs—capture that in a cell.

🛠 Customization & Extensions

If you'd like to modify the notebook:

    Adjust hyperparameters: change learning rate, batch size, or number of epochs.

    Change architecture: add more CNN layers, adjust filter sizes, or introduce residual blocks.

    Data augmentation: add random crops, flips, color jitter.

    Save & load model weights: use torch.save() or model.save() to persist your trained model.

    Deployment: export the model for inference via scripts (not covered in the notebook).

✅ Tips

    Use GPU: For faster training, ensure CUDA is enabled or specify device='cuda'.

    Run manually, not via GitHub UI: Notebooks require interactive execution; cloning and launching locally or in Binder is best.

    Create a requirements.txt: If you want others to reproduce your setup, capturing exact library versions helps.

    Keep final cell descriptive: Summarize results and insights (e.g., “best accuracy reached”, “limitations”, or ideas for improvement).

📝 Summary

This repository delivers a clean, educational demonstration of CIFAR‑10 image classification—with code, outputs, and visualizations neatly organized in a single notebook. It's ideal for experiment tracking, coursework demonstration, or extension into more complex image tasks.
